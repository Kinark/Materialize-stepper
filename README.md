## IMPORTANT!
#### Do. Or do not. There is no try.

###### This is a total refactoring of materialize-stepper. For a year this project has been abandoned, but since a lot of people uses it, I decided to make everything from scratch. Since the latest stable version don't work anymore, this is the beta and the official working version right now. When it gets stable enough, I'll release it as a stable version.

### NOT SO IMPORTANT!
#### PATIENCE YOU MUST HAVE my young padawan

###### The author of this project is looking for a job in Canada or USA. If you need a good worker, maybe he's the guy ;D

![Small demo](docs/images/small_demo.gif)  

A little plugin, inspired by [MDL-Stepper](https://ahlechandre.github.io/mdl-stepper/), that implements a stepper to [Materializecss framework](http://materializecss.com/).

Demo: https://kinark.github.io/Materialize-stepper/  
Codepen Playground: https://codepen.io/Kinark/pen/VKrjJp

## [Documentation](https://kinark.github.io/Materialize-stepper/)

The documentation once belonged to this readme, before the force's sleep. However, it's awaken once more, in the gh-pages this time.

[Go check it out!](https://kinark.github.io/Materialize-stepper/)


## Limitations

None, I think :)

## Final observations

* Every command works like an accordion collapsible. If you trigger "openStep(step)" or "nextStep()", it'll close the active step, remove any feedback screen and execute their functions.
